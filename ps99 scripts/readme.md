### Description of only the ps99 files
- [fish.py](./fish.py) -> Made for auto-fishing in the Roblox game Pet Simulator 99
    - Use one of the many ahk macros, this is trash

- [pet simulator chance list](./ps99%20luck%20calculator.py) -> Search up a pet from the egg, pick what egg you're looking for, and you can see the base odds for all the pets in the egg
    - If there is only one egg, it is automatically chosen

- [chest open](./chest%20open.py) -> made for opening chests in ps99

- [ps99 auto fuse](./auto%20fuse.py) -> made for automatically fusing pets
    - To start it, go to the world 1 fuse machine located in area 28 and open the menu. open the script and it will start automatically. If the script breaks, go to line 35 and change `num:int=2` to `num:int=3`.
    - To stop the script, shove your mouse into any corner for about half a second at most.

- [ps99 auto ultimate](./auto%20ultimate.py) -> Will automatically use whatever ultimate you have equipped when it's ready.
    - Will only run if Roblox is focused
    - change the end of line 8 to 1 == 1 to skip checking if the ultimate is ready and press r every ten seconds regardless
        - useful if you don't have a 1080p screen
    - easy as running the script and letting it run in the background

- [ps99 auto spinny wheel](./auto%20spinny%20wheel.py) -> Automatically spins spinny wheel if there's a huge. If not, goes to next world
    - I plan to add another option where you can only use one world instead of having to use all three.
