There's currently only one file here, but perhaps that will change-

#### Description of files
[fish.py](./fish.py) -> Made for auto-fishing in the Roblox game Pet Simulator 99

[turtle pics](./find%20turtle%20pics.py) -> gui made to find the turtle pics in the spotify experiment, "he-brings-you-playback-progress". Uses [Rinuwaii's](https://github.com/rinuwaii) json file found [here](https://github.com/rinuwaii/he-brings-you-playback-progress/blob/main/heBringsYouPlaybackProgress.json), renamed to `list.json` in the file for simplicity.

[ps profile script](./powershell%20profile%20scripts.ps1) -> second function (turtlesong) was not intended to be related to turtle pics, was used for downloading snippets of a stream, and output to ./turtlesongs/
- first function was more of a test than anything else tbh
