There's currently only one file here, but perhaps that will change-

#### Description of files
[fish.py](./fish.py) -> Made for auto-fishing in the Roblox game Pet Simulator 99

[turtle pics](./find%20turtle%20pics.py) -> gui made to find the turtle pics in the spotify experiment, "he-brings-you-playback-progress". Uses [Rinuwaii's](https://github.com/rinuwaii) json file found [here](https://github.com/rinuwaii/he-brings-you-playback-progress/blob/main/heBringsYouPlaybackProgress.json), renamed to `list.json` in the file for simplicity.

[ps profile script](./powershell%20profile%20scripts.ps1) -> second function (turtlesong) was not intended to be related to turtle pics, was used for downloading snippets of a stream, and output to ./turtlesongs/
- first function was more of a test than anything else tbh
- if they are not in your path, change adb, yt-dlp (or youtube-dl, should work with it too) and ffmpeg to their proper locations. (lines 6, 23, 26 respectively)

[8 ball pool free cure redeem](./8ballpoolredeem.py) -> Check out my other repository featuring a discord bot! -- [Github Repository](https://github.com/Flyingbacen/Discord-rawrbot)
- This is just stolen from there, since I'm apparently too lazy to re set it up so that the bot boots with my computer

[owo auto](./owo%20auto.py) -> made for the owo bot in discord. makes messy blob messages sometimes, shouldn't happen anymore though
- broken version is broken. make a pull request if you think you can fix it :)
